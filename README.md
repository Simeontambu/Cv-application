# CV Application

## Assignment

1. Create a new React project using the Vite framework (or any other preferred setup).

2. Think about how to structure your application into components. Your CV application should include the following sections:

- General Information: This section should allow users to add their name, email, and phone number.

- Education: Users should be able to add their educational experience, including the school name, title of study, and dates of study.

- Work Experience: This section should allow users to add their practical experience, including the company name, position title, main responsibilities, and dates of employment.

3. Each section or the entire CV should have an edit and submit button. The submit button should display the input field values in HTML elements after submission. The edit button should display the input fields again, pre-filled with the previously entered information. Users should be able to edit and resubmit the content. To accomplish this, you will need to make heavy use of state and props. Make sure you have a solid understanding of these concepts before proceeding.

Remember to break down your application into reusable components, following best practices for component structure and organization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CV application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or create a new project using Vite.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application in your preferred web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

Feel free to customize the design and layout of your CV application to match your preferences. Experiment with different React features and techniques as you build out the functionality.
